telbase - External telephone numbers database for Android
Copyright 2011-2012  Alexander Nartov

Description
-----------
telbase is an application for Android that enables you to lookup
telephone numbers in external (not-in-Contacts) database.

Numbers and their corresponding owners are stored in SQLite database.
It's up to you where to find and how to add data to your base.
I suggest generating a SQL script with INSERT queries and feed it
to sqlite3 program.

The main feature of this program is the ability to see number's owner
in a "toast" over the incoming/ongoing call screens.

It's also possible to lookup numbers using the main activity GUI.

Permissions
-----------
telbase requires READ_PHONE_STATE permission to automatically
show the name of a number's owner when you receive an incoming call.
